# Architecture decision records (ADR)

All architectural decisions must be logged within this directory.

To create an ADR: 

1. Make a copy of [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md).
2. Complete the given sections in the template.
3. Run the `./Generate-AdrIndex` script to update the summary table below.
4. Submit a pull request to propose the ADR.
5. Work through any feedback until the ADR is accepted or rejected.

Please note that not all technical decisions are architectural decisions. An architectural decision relates to:

- architectural characteristcs (also known as  NFRs or CFRs)
- dependencies
- external interfaces
- construction techniques
