# ADR028 - Simplify DEDS schema to store JSON documents

- **Status**: Draft
- **Date**: 2025-02-24
- **Author**: Stuart Maskell

## Decision

Replace the existing DEDS full entity graph schema (taken from International spec v3.0 HSDS schema), and replace it with a simpler schema where the incoming JSON is stored directly rather than being split into various relational tables.

## Context

The existing DEDS schema models the OR international v3.0 spec. This was likely done because we were attempting to understand Open Referral Data Specification ourselves, and the International spec is what we were most likely to ingest. Since then it's seeming more likely that we'll be ingesting various data types, such as OpenReferral UK (A subset of International) and file upload which does not conform to any OpenReferral specification.

Trying to implement this became really complicated using the existing DEDS schema. The question arose as to whether we could do things differently with less complexity.


## Options considered


1. Store the JSON data as a string/JSON field in the database with minimal other columns to represent data.
2. Do nothing and keep the current full entity graph schema.

## Consequences

### Option 1

- Little complexity storing data as we simply store the JSON document in a JSON field. As opposed to pulling the full graph JSON document, deserialising, inserting many rows into many tables, which is slower and more complex as an implementation
- Retains the original document from the third party.
- Updating data is simplified to an overwrite of the JSON field, rather than querying and updating a full normalized entity graph. This eliminates the complexity of field mapping in large models.
- The most complexity is when retrieving data from the database, mapping of each version of JSON data is required to extract the information we need.
- Increased storage size, as storing JSON will require more space than a fully normalized SQL schema. Unlike a normalized entity graph that uses references, JSON storage can contain data duplication within its own structure, this is the nature of JSON."
   - Number of Family Hubs = 431
   - Number of VCFS = average 1000 per LA
   - Average file size = 13.5kb (Minified JSON) taken from Mock HSDS in the repo and a sample of a Somerset service

### Option 2

- There is complexity when ingesting data, mapping of each version of data is required to create on the DB schema.
- Supporting future Open Referral versions will require us to update the DEDS schema to reflect schema changes in the DB
- Mismatches may occur when mapping third party field types to our schema. This may necessitate additional work to map within both our code and database, for example, if their ID field is an integer and ours is a UUID.
- More mental overhead for developers dealing with such a large entity model.
- All the data stored is kept in a single normalized SQL schema.

## Advice

- Aaron Yarnborough - Tech lead - 2025-02-20
   - Storing JSON means we don't have to deserialise into separate relational tables, saving processing time and DB load
   - Doesn't require many tables for each entity, meaning fewer DB items to maintain
   - Use composite key for uniqueness between third party serviceId and third party Id.
   - Add in JSON normalization (minify) to improve comparison checking.
