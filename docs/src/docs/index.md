# Welcome

## Overview

This is a quickstart template for creating technical documentation using the [docs-as-code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) approach.

Clone the [repository](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/tech-docs-template) to start creating [accessible](#features), [version-controlled](#version-control), [governed](#change-management) documentation for your project.

## Features

### Acronyms and abbreviations

Hovering your mouse over any TLA will reveal a tooltip with its definition.

You can tell if a TLA has a definition because it will be underlined.

!!! info "Adding new acronyms"
    Define your glossary in `includes/glossary.md`. Tooltips will be added
	automatically whenever that acronym is used in any page.

### Side notes

#### Callouts

Callouts draw the readers attention to important information.
The callouts below are collapsible; click them to expand.

??? tip "This is a tip"
    This advice may be handy here.

??? warning "This is a warning"
    Caution is needed here.

??? danger "This indicates danger"
    There is a critical potential pitfall here.

??? abstract "This is a placeholder"
    More details are needed here.

??? note "This is a note"
    Extra information is here.

### Search

If you are looking for something specific, the search bar at the top is the fastest way there.

??? "Learn more about search"
    The mkdocs-material documentation has more information on [how search works](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/search/) and [how to configure it](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-site-search/).

### Navigation

* *Top-level sections* can be navigated using the links on the left-hand menu.
* *Sub-sections* are shown on the right-hand menu.

!!! tip "Keeping track of your place"
    The right-hand menu helpfully updates as you scroll.

### Dark Mode

The documentation recognises your system preferences and automatically activates dark mode to reduce eye-strain.

!!! tip "Switching on Dark Mode"
    Use the :fontawesome-solid-sun: icon in the top-right to manually toggle dark mode.

#### Footnotes

Tangential information can be added as a footnote.[^1]
This allows extra information to be added without interrupting the flow.

!!! tip "Footnotes automatically become links"
    Click to jump to a footnote, then click the arrow to jump back again.

[^1]: This footnote serves no real purpose other than to demonstrate how footnotes work.
      Click the arrow to go back to where you were.

## User guide

This section describes how to work with the documentation and how to make changes.

### Markup

This documentation is written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
It is compiled with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and styled with a DfE-tailored version of the [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/) theme.

### Diagrams

Diagrams can be created with [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/).
Mermaid lets you create diagrams and visualisations using text and code.
This makes it easy to keep them up-to-date.

!!! info "Learn more about Mermaid"
    Consult the [Mermaid Documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) for examples and tutorials.

### Version control

By version-controlling your documentation with git you get benefits like:

* **Branching:** Work on different versions in parallel without affecting the main version.
* **History Tracking**: Every change is recorded, allowing you to revert to previous versions.
* **Backup and Recovery:** Protect against data loss with remote repository backups.

### Change management

You may like to set up [branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule) to ensure changes are properly governed (e.g. require at least one review before merging to the `main` branch).

### Building locally

Serve the documentation by running:

```bash
$ pip install mkdocs-material
$ mkdocs serve
```

### Deployment

!!! abstract "TODO"
    Document deployment options for serving static content to:

    * All DfE users
    * Specific DfE users
    * The general public
